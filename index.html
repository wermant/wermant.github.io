                            A garden designing program coded in Java. This program allows you to input your garden conditions and budget
                            and lets you design a garden consisting of native plants that can survive in the climate of your garden. After
                            the garden is designed, you will be presented a list of some of the lepidopteras that your garden will attract.

                            This webscraper was written entirely in Python and uses the Tkinter library to present the user with a interactable 
                            GUI interface to search up information on any One Piece character. I also converted the python file into an executable
                            so it can be used from any computer.
